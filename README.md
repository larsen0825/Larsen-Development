 This is my portfolio website.
 This site started as a basic html skeleton as a project for my introduction to frontend at Career Foundry. 
 Since completing the course, I have learned a lot through trial and error. I've added my first react feature, complex css, javascript, and more!
 I'm currently studying the same as i was before completing the front end course. I'm working on improving my knowledge and experience with javascript & react. 
 I'm also spendinng this time to refresh what i've learned by breaking my code and fixing it. I believe everything i've learned through this project is only half   the battle. In the real development world the job is the ability to learn constantly, and know how to fix what's broken. Problem solving has always been a rewarding challenge for me. 
I'm seeeking work as a front end developer, and i hope to find a match with a company that can help me grow, while i also deliver my skills to further their mission.
